# TRIANGLE REFUGEE STUDENT PROJECT

Thanks for checking out the HTML source for the Triangle Refugee Student Project Webpage.
I don't know why you're here to be honest, but I'm glad you are.

At the moment, the website looks very bad, or outright unviewable, on every platform except a fullscreen desktop. That works for now, but I'll fix it when it's time for more people to see it. Sorry about the eyesore.

All the original content I made for this webpage is licensed under CC NC-BY-SA and should be credited to Andrew Lynch. 
Everything I didn't make is explicitly tagged in its respective page, and is available under its own license.

Have a lovely day :)
