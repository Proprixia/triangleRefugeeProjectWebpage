            <h1> Andrew Lynch </h1>
            <p> 
                Andrew is a Boy Scout from Apex, North Carolina. He's currently a life scout, the second highest rank in Scouting, beneath only Eagle.
                When he saw the human consequences of the Fall of Kabul and the Russian Invasion of Ukraine, he was motivated to do something to help.
                Since all scouts who want to become Eagles are required to organize a community service project, Andrew decided he would use that 
                opportunity to make a difference. A few project applications later, the Triangle Refugee Student Project was born. Through the project, 
                Andrew hopes to make the world just a little bit better.
            
                <br> <br>
                Outside of Scouting, Andrew is a friend, a brother, and a son. He is also a high school student, a hobbyist programmer, 
                an amateur researcher, a pool attendant and a dreamer. He lives in Apex with parents, his sister, his brother, and his dog. 
                He hopes to make the world a little better in everything he does.
