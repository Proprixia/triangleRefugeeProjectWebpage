            <div class="problemParagraph"> Every day, thousands of children are forced to flee their homes. From Afghanistan to Myanmar, Ukraine to Venezuela, they flee by the thousands, 
            and many end up right here in the Triangle. These students often face immense hurdles to education, being forced to adapt to a new home and often a new language, facing hatred in their new 
            home, and even lacking the basic supplies they need. <b> The Triangle Refugee Student Project seeks to help. </b> </div>

            <div class="callToActionTopHeading"> <h1> WHO ARE WE? </h1> </div>
            <div class="callToActionParagraph"> 
                <p> <b> We are the Triangle Refugee Student Project, </b> an Eagle Scout service project by local boy scout Andrew Lynch. 
                With collection locations across Apex, Cary, and Raleigh, we are collecting school supplies on behalf of the United States Committee for Refugees and Immigrants of North Carolina.
                Through their School Impact Case Program, USCRI serves about 100 local refugee students, providing them with assistance, both for connecting with the school system, and having their physical supplies.
                Unfortunately, it's hard to get school supplies for 100 students. <b> That's where you come in. </b> With your help, we can help USCRI with their goals, and give every kid a chance. </p>
